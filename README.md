## Project Description
This repository contains a series of test projects aimed at demonstrating key concepts and techniques in back-end test automation. The focus is on unit testing, decoupling, and mocking using the Moq framework in C#.

## Key Concepts
- Unit Testing: Writing tests to verify the smallest units of code independently.
- Decoupling: Reducing dependencies between components to make the system more modular and testable.
- Mocking: Using the Moq framework to simulate objects and behaviors for testing purposes.
## Technologies Used
- C#: The primary programming language used for the test projects.
- Moq: A popular mocking framework for .NET.
- NUnit: A unit-testing framework for all .NET languages.
## GetGreeting Project
- GetGreeting.Tests: Contains the unit tests for the GetGreeting project.
- GetGreeting: The main project for the GetGreeting application.
## ItemManagement Project
- ItemManagementApp: Contains the application logic for managing items.
- ItemManagementLib: A library containing core functionalities for item management.
- ItemManagementTests: Contains unit tests for the ItemManagement project.
## Prerequisites
- .NET 6.0 SDK or higher
