### This is a test project for **Back-End Tehnologies** January 2024 Course @ SoftUni
---

## Project Description
This repository showcases several test projects designed to demonstrate essential techniques in back-end testing. The focus is primarily on unit testing, decoupling, and using the Moq framework for mocking dependencies in C#.

## Core Concepts
- **Unit Testing:** Testing individual units of code in isolation to ensure they function as expected.
- **Decoupling:** Minimizing dependencies between system components, enabling easier testing and greater modularity.
- **Mocking:** Leveraging the Moq framework to create mock objects that simulate real dependencies, allowing for controlled testing scenarios.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Moq:** A powerful and flexible mocking framework for .NET that simplifies creating test doubles.
- **NUnit:** A widely used testing framework for writing and running tests in .NET environments.
  
## Projects in the Repository
### 1. GetGreeting Project
- **GetGreeting.Tests:** Contains unit tests designed to validate the functionality of the GetGreeting application.
- **GetGreeting:** The main application project responsible for generating personalized greetings.

### 3. ItemManagement Project
- **ItemManagementApp:** The main application logic for managing items, including adding, updating, and removing items.
- **ItemManagementLib:** A shared library that contains the core functionalities used by the ItemManagementApp.
- **ItemManagementTests:** A collection of unit tests written to validate the behavior and functionality of the ItemManagement project.

## Requirements
To run and modify these test projects, youâ€™ll need:

- .NET 6.0 SDK or higher
- Visual Studio 2022 or later / Visual Studio Codee
